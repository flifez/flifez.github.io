![Neptune](/assets/images/scr00006.png)

The picture of October is a glimpse of Neptune using *SpaceEngine*, representing the real situation on *Oct. 1, 2022*.

It was taken about 30AU away from Neptune, at 30 degrees declination, with an axis inclination of about 10 degrees.

It is interesting to note that the photo emphasizes Neptune's rings which is usually not so visible. On its right side, Triton is clearly visible.

Unfortunately, the photo does not capture Neptune's signature GDS-89 "big black spot" anticyclone / cloud-free area.

Nothing really happened. I just shelved this blog for like 1 year and focused on studying and unfortunately I have to make one from stratch now.

This article is my heartfelt message. Rarely do I write those stuff, not to mention publishing online. But here I would like to have this done.

So if you don't want to read this long and boring thing, I suggest you should click "Previous Page" or that cute little close button on the browser tab. This saves your time a lot. :)

## Ok...

The year is bittersweet. Under so much pressure I got fucked up, had serious mental issues and even thought about suiciding. Seeing this some people may doubt that, "Again this bitter drama trash?" Yeah, I can even imagine those sour faces. **To reiterate**: if you don't like this passage or you don't want to read it, just simply exit, and your time and my emotions will all be saved.

Bitter is countless.

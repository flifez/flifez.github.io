Last month (Aug. 2022), I installed macOS Monterey 12.5.1 (the latest version at the time) on a H-110 system I once used to install macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 using üçÄ. That installation was perfect but I deleted it by mistake.

This time, I did the following things:

- [x] Successfully install and run;
- [x] Patch network, ~~audio I/O~~ audio out, USB mapping;
- [x] Patch my GTX 1050 Ti GPU at least to run;
- [ ] Patch Metal for the GPU (WebDriver before Mojave)

Because my PC does not have a microphone and a webcam, I did not list them above.

### First things first...

As this is the first time I have looked into Hackintosh things since 2019, I did not know the mainstream method of installing Hackintosh now. So without checking documents, I downloaded a macOS 12.5.1 image and this took me about 3 hours. However, it turned out that I'm just working for nothing -- today they recommend using `BaseSystem.dmg` or something like that (i.e. macOS Recovery) to do a fresh install.

Also, this process was fully automatic. Just use an one-line command provided by OpenCore, it will download the image you'll need to use and then, the show began.

### USB configuration and `config.plist`

Another evident change is that you need to do "USB mapping" before starting other processes, otherwise you will get a boot loop.

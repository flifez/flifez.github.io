### Picture of the Month

The picture of Octuber is a glimpse of Neptune using SpaceEngine, representing the real situation of Oct. 1, 2022.

It was taken about 30AU away from Neptune, at 30 degrees declination, with an axis inclination of about 10 degrees.

It is interesting to note that the photo emphasizes Neptune's rings which is usually not so visible. On its right side, Triton is clearly visible.

Unfortunately, the photo does not capture Neptune's signature GDS-89 "big black spot" anticyclone / cloud-free area.
